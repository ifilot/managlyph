## Overview
Enhance your lectures with three-dimensional chemical structures using this
interactive platform. Display molecular structures, atomic orbitals, and
elementary reaction steps with visually engaging 3D effects.

## Features

- **Anaglyph Projection**: Enjoy 3D visualizations with a simple pair of
  red/cyan glasses. Supports interlacing for 3D monitors and projectors.
- **Atomic Orbitals**: Build, project, and rotate atomic orbitals up to 4f,
  enabling a deep dive into atomic structure.
- **Elementary Reaction Steps**: Illustrate complex reaction mechanisms by
  sliding along the reaction coordinate, pausing to highlight key events.
